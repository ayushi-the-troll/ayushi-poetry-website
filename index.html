                <p>her mail and packages</br>stacked up</br>like she’s gone on vacation</br>like she’ll be back to pick it up</br>i bet if the postman knew</br>that the house is forever empty</br>he would throw it away</br>like it meant nothing</br>i wonder what’s in that package</br>what did she buy?</br>was it a kitchen knife,</br>baking supplies,</br>or maybe a book she wanted to read?</br>a book that would never make</br>it onto her “finally finished” list</br>her excitement for that gift</br>died with her in her sleep</br>   <em>she don’t need it anymore</em></br>    <em>she’s got heaven baby</em></br>but she didn’t even get to touch</br>the last thing she bought</p>

                <h4>never meant to be</h4>
                <p>it's been off for me</br>for the past few months you've been</br>teasing and lying</br>i felt it since that day</br>that day when i got mad</br>but i fought for us</br>i fought for us but you threw it away</br>you threw us away like those baby shoes</br>bought but never worn,</br>never worn, never loved, never used</br>but you used me as a consolation prize</br>a prize to lift you up</br>up in your dreams when she pulled you down</br>down into the depths of sadness</br>i should've broken it off then</br>i should've listened to myself</br>that we couldn't be fixed</br>that we were never meant to be</p>
